<h3>Technical Overview</h3>


The point-of-sale system is built using the following technologies and frameworks:



* Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose
* Frontend: React, Bootstrap
* Authentication and Authorization: Passport.js, JSON Web Tokens (JWT)

The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js, which provide a scalable and efficient server-side scripting environment. The data layer is managed using MongoDB, a NoSQL database that offers high performance and scalability. Mongoose, an object modeling tool, is used to define the schema and models for the data layer.

The frontend is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Bootstrap, a responsive design framework, is used for styling the user interface.

Authentication and authorization are managed using Passport.js, a popular authentication middleware for Node.js. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used to securely transmit user data between the client and the server.

The system follows a three-tier architecture:



* Presentation Layer: The presentation layer is built using React and Bootstrap. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing appointments, inventory, payments, customers, and employees.
* Application Layer: The application layer is built using Express.js. It provides the business logic for processing user requests, interacting with the database, and generating reports.
* Data Layer: The data layer is built using MongoDB and Mongoose. It provides a secure and scalable storage solution for managing user data, appointment data, inventory data, payment data, customer data, and employee data.
